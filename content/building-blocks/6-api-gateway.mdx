  - External APIs
  - Contract btw client and microservices
  - Abstraction layer, remove deps of client on microservices

- Techniques

  - API Composition
  - Monitoring
  - Authentication
  - Rate limiting

- third-party:

  - AWS

- cons:

  - slow down reqs
  - complicated

- Optimizations

  - Need for fault-tolerance: more instances, with LBs upfront
  - Separation of concerns:
    - multiple types of api gateways (mobile, web)
    - configure LB to redirect reqs to correct API gateway
