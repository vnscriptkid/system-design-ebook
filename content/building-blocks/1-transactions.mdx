## ACID: 4 properties of transaction

- atomicity (abortability):
  - indivisible unit,
  - succeeds when all operations succeeds
  - fails when at least one operation fails
- consistency (correctness)
  - if error happens in transaction, changes are reversed so data remains consistent
- isolation
  - before commit, updates are made on a snapshot of database instead of directly modifying database
  - context: parallel transactions manipulate the same data
  - diff isolation levels
- durability
  - once commit is done, all changes is persisted to disk and inreversible
  - how? WAL records (write-ahead log) must be written to WAL segment in the disk

## Use cases

- Transfer money: Tom transfers 100 bucks to Lisa

```js
// START transaction
// take 100$ out of Tom's account
// add 100$ to Lisa's account
// COMMIT
transaction(() => {
  takeMoneyFrom('Tom', 100)
  addMoneyFor('Lisa', 100)
})
```

- Flight booking

```js
// START transaction
// reserve a ticket
// update availability
// charge user's account
// COMMIT
transaction(() => {
  reserveTicket(ticketId)
  updateAvailability(ticketId)
  chargeUser(userId)
})
```

- Make an ecommerce order

```js
// START transaction
// update availability
// process payment
// create order
// COMMIT
transaction(() => {
  updateAvailability(productId)
  chargeMoney(user, total)
  createOrder(user, items)
})
```

- Ecommerce inventory

```js
products {
  id: int,
  name: varchar,
  price: float,
}

inventory {
  product_id: int,
  quantity: int
}

orders {
  id: int,
  user_id: int,
  product_id: int,
  price: int,
  quantity: int,
  createdAt: datetime
}
```

```sql
### purchase product flow
### step 1: check product exists
select * from products where id = 1;
### step 2: update inventory
update inventory set quantity = quantity - 10 where product_id = 1;
### step 3: create new order
insert into orders (user_id, product_id, price, quantity)
values (99, 1, 10);
```

```js
// ATOMICITY
/*
|              User 1          | InventoryRow(product_id=1, quantity=100)
|                              |
| START TRANSACTION            |
|                              |
|        checkProductExists    | ProductRow(id=1)
|                              |
|        updateInventory(-10)  | @@InventoryRow(product_id=1, quantity=90)
|                              |
|        xxxxx                 |
|                              |
| ROLLBACK                     | ^^InventoryRow(product_id=1, quantity=100)
|                              |

## Different Context

- Single data store
- Multiple data stores (distributed systems)

## Questions

- 2 phase locking vs 2 phase commit
  - 2 phase commit: distributed transaction
- Is ordering in transaction matter? depends on business

## Concurrency control models

- MVCC
- Locking

## 2 phase commit

- Context: Transaction includes operations that modify multiple data stores.
- Goal:
  - transaction succeeds if all operations are successful
  - if at least one operation fails, then transaction fails
- components:
  - 1 coordinator
  - many participants
- 2 phases:
  - PREPARE
    - coordinator sends commit reqs to different data sources, wait for ack
    - if there's any failing commit, the whole transaction fails, rollback all commits
  - COMMIT
    - if transaction COMMIT, data is guaranteed to be in the disk
- pros and cons
  - cons: low latency, blocking protocol (if coordinator or a participant goes down)
  - pros: strong consistency
- use cases:
- implementation: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMhESvU87jM&list=PLsdq-3Z1EPT1wfRQo2xrrst2SGremT_qd

## Choosing dbs:

- relational dbs:
  - use cases: consistency, rollback
- non-relational dbs:
  - cassandra, dynamoDB: not consistent
  - hBase, bigQuery: high latency

## Lock types

- exclusive lock (write lock)
  - only one transaction can hold `write lock` at a time, no other transaction can hold `read lock`
- shared lock (read lock)
  - multiple transactions can hold `read lock` at the same time
- Questions:
  - db level or row level => diff modes: table, row, advisory (postgres)
  - error or wait when can't take the lock => wait
- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nuBi2XbHH18
- why?
  - consistency, isolation

## 2 phase locking

- use case: booking app
- prepare data:

```sql
# Arrange
create database netflix;
create table movie (id serial, booked_by varchar(50), is_booked boolean not null);
insert into movie (is_booked, booked_by) values (false, null);
select * from movie;

### Booking flow
# (1): check movie exists
select * from movie where id = 1;
# (2): update availability
update movie set is_booked = true, booked_by = 'thanh' where id = 1;

### 2 phase locking
#   thanh                        |   linh                               |
#   START TRANSACTION            |                                      |
#                                | START TRANSACTION                    |
#   select movie 1 FOR UPDATE    |                                      | thanh take exclusive lock on movie 1 row
#   |     ...               |    | |select movie 1 FOR UPDATE|(BLOCKED) |
#   |     ...               |    | |           xxx           |          |
#                                | |           xxx           |          |
#   |update movie 1|             | |           xxx           |          |
#   |     ...      |             | |           xxx           |          |
#   |     ...      |             | |           xxx           |          |
#        COMMIT                  | |           xxx           |          |  movie 1 { is_booked: true, booked_by: 'thanh' } (thanh's view)
#                                | |           ...           |          |
#                                | |           ...           |          |  movie 1 { is_booked: true, booked_by: 'thanh' } => !!! Ooops (linh's view)
#                                | ROLL BACK
```

- double booking simulation:

### Double booking scenario 1
#     thanh             |   linh                    |

# 2                     | START TRANSACTION         |

```

- use transaction alone won't prevent double-booking
- each user has his own view about movie 1 row (MVCC)
  - line 7: thanh sees movie 1 as being booked by himself
  - line 9: linh sees movie as not being booked by anyone
- idea to solve: after thanh starting his transaction, linh should not be able to even read the row until thanh completes his transaction

## isolation levels

- read committed (default) => works most of the time

```js
/*   
|    User 1                  |            User 2            | A=1, B=2, C=3
|                            |                              |
|     start transaction      |                              |
|                            |        start transaction     |
|         A=A+1              |                              | @@A=2
|                            |          B=B+1               | @@B=3
|                            |          C=C+2               | @@C=5
|                            |        commit                |  ^^ B=3, C=5
|         Read B =>3         |                              |
|                            |                              |
*/
```

- repeatable read (MVCC) => expensive

```sql
begin transaction isolation level repeatable read;
```

```js
/*   
|    User 1                  |            User 2            | A=1, B=2, C=3
|                            |                              |
|     start transaction      |                              |
|                            |        start transaction     |
|         A=A+1              |                              | @@A=2
