slug: /building-blocks/replication-arch

## Why?

- Add reliability, fault-lolerance, high availability
- Improve performance
  - Higher throughput: 1 master handles reads, slaves handle writes
  - Lower latency: region-based replicas
  - Avoid hotspot, one machine handles all reads and writes

## Why not? (cons)

- Slow writes (sync)
- Complex (multi-masters)
- Eventual consistency (async)
- Add redundancy

## Replication models

#### 1. Master-Slaves

- 1 master + many slaves
- write to master (propagated to slaves async => 1-way replication)
- read from slaves (optimize for reads)
- pros: simple to implement
- cons: writes don't scale (only operate on 1 machine)
- re-election:
  - master goes down, amongst slaves, new master gets elected
  - during which, writes get blocked

#### 2. Master-Master

- all are the same
- all can handle reads and writes

#### 3. Multi-Masters

- cons: complex, need for conflict resolution
- pros: writes do scale

## Sync vs Async Replications

- Sync:
  - master gets blocked until data is written to n slaves (n is configurable)
- Async:
  - write considered done after it gets persisted to master
  - subsequent updates to replicas is done by background jobs.

## Questions

- why replication (benefits, pros)?
- cons of replication?
- in master-slaves, why to write only to master?
- which models to choose?
- why #nodes in replication set should be odd?

## Mongodb-specific

- Write concerns
  - default: only write to master, replicating is async
  - others: `majority`, `2`, ... (including master)
- Read pref
  - default: read from master
  - others: `primaryPreferred`, `secondary` (potential eventual consistency), `nearest`

## kafka contexts

- partitions are replicated over different broker instances (broker/machine)
- replication factor defines how many partitions per replicas set
- master-slaves models:
  - one leader takes all reads-writes
  - followers stay in sync with leader, are used in case of failure
