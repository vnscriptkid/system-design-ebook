## 2 paradigms

- optimistic:
  - if fails, then retries
  - nosql
- pestimistic:
  - locks
  - postgresql

## lockings (postgres-specific)

- explicit
- implicity
  - precondition: within transaction `begin ... commit`
  - depending on what operation is? a lock is used implicitly
    - `select` => shared lock
    - `update` => exclusive lock
