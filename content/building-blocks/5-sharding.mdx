## Why?

- when amount of data grows up, can not be fit into one single machine. it's time to split it up into smaller chunks,
  and put each chunk into one single machine so that you can scale infinitely.

## Problems?

- Must be a consistent way of writing a new record to database
- Must be a way to know find which machine a record resides in

## Context?

- Distributed Database
- Distributed Cache
- Distributed Key-value Store
- Distributed Hash-table

## Questions?

- redis vs memcached vs rabbitMQ
