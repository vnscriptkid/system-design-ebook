title: Sharding
slug: /building-blocks/sharding

## Why?

- when amount of data grows up, can not be fit into one single machine. it's time to split it up into smaller chunks,
  and put each chunk into one single machine so that you can scale infinitely.
- benefits:
  - horizontal scaling
  - reduce workload for database (reads and writes)
  - reduce latency as there's less data in each shard

## Problems?

- Must be a consistent way of writing a new record to database
- Must be a way to know find which machine a record resides in
- Cross-shards reads are difficult
  - know your queries first before sharding
  - example: fetching group chat messages must be done in one shard

## Context?

- Distributed Database
- Distributed Cache
- Distributed Key-value Store
- Distributed Hash-table

## Strategies

- Partition function (hash-based)

  - the client decides which machine to go
  - How: hash(key) % NUMBER_OF_MACHINES = #dest_machine
  - cons:
    - remapping (number of nodes changes)
    - hotspot
  - pros: simplicity

- Dynamic sharding (key range-based)

  - the job of determining which server to go is transfered to LocatorService
  - LocatorService keeps track of key ranges with corresponding machine
  - flow: (1) client ask LocatorService with provided key (2) LocatorService find which server to go for client with that given key
  - pros:
  - cons:
    - SoF: use replicas
  - consecutive keys are likely to be in the same shard

- Consistent hashing
  - why? avoid remapping everything
  - how?
    - use a ring, holding key range (0 -> N)
    - distributes server evenly in the ring
    - `hashFn(key) = hashValue` => X = hashValue % N
    - locate X on the ring, find the nearest node clockwise
  - optimize: virtual nodes, why?

## Grouping data

- Context: social network app, vietnamese ppl will more likely to contact with vietnamese, other than US
  - group by geographic location: asia cluster & america cluster => low latency
  - avoid cross-cluster calls: a vietnamese has friend in us => replicate data on both sides

## Questions?

- redis vs memcached vs rabbitMQ
- diagram, and provide explicity numbers for partition function
- context: partition function, key-value store. how remapping is implemented
- Diff sharding vs replication? Is this mutual-exclusive? Which one should i choose in real-world?
