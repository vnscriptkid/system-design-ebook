## basics

- alternative: polling (client periodically sends reqs to server asking for new data)
- websockets: server proactively pushes new data to clients when there's new data
- how: client-server maintains a persistent tcp connection
- websocket is a level 7 protocol
- use cases(real-time app): multi-player games, group chat (discord, slack, fb messenger), financial trading apps

## models

- pull:
  - REST: client reqs, server responds with data
  - polling (chat app: do you have any new messages for me?)
- push:
  - APNs (apple push notif) / GCM (google cloud messaging)
  - web socket (persistent conn)
  - heartbeat (online/offline presense feature: `I'm alive`,...)

## naive setup

- single ws server, acts as a pubsub itself

## scalable setup

- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gzIcGhJC8hA
- multiple ws servers

## questions?

- full-duplex? bi-directional nature btw server-client of websocket
- half-duplex? uni-directional of polling
