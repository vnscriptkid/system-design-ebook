## Why?

- Use resources effectively. How?
  - Leverage async communication: client and server don't need to be present in the whole transaction
  - Decouple system components through a queue

## Use cases:

- Sending transactional emails: might not need immediate response, no need to block server while sending email

## Components:

- Workers
- Notifiers
- Load balancing
- Heartbeat
