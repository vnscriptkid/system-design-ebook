title: Message queues
slug: /building-blocks/message-queue

## Why?

- Sync communication:
  - chain of deps, senders and receivers both must be present
  - need for maintaining long-lived conn
- Broadcast events to many services:
  - one to many
  - does not scale well with sync comm
  - pub/sub comes to rescue
- Traffic peaks
  - many to one
  - analytics service: receive events from all directions of the system
- ensure reqs are gonna be handled
  - retries multiple times if it fails
  - after configurable amount of times, returns error msg

## What?

- Decouple deps between senders and receivers by a message queue
- Do not block users for a long time,
  - the request from user is pushed to the queue (hey, someone pls process it)
  - a confirmation of processing can be returned right away

## Use cases:

- Sending transactional emails:
  - might not need immediate response, no need to block server while sending email
  - one to one
- Sending propotional emails:
  - no need for low latency
  - pub/sub one to many

## patterns:

- distributed queues: one to one (a message contains one sender and one receiver)
- pubsub: one to many (a message contains one sender and many receivers)
  - put each consumer in one consumer group? why?

## components/features:

- queueing
  - no messages lost (if receivers can't keep up with traffic peaks)
- routing
- distributed systems:
  - multi message brokers
  - auto-scaling, fault-tolerant
- pub/sub
- data transformation
- validation

## cons:

- complexity (distributed system)
- higher latency

## consuming messages methods

- push
  - message broker actively pushes messages to consumers
- pull
  - consumers actively takes out messages from message queue.
  - use case: analytics service?
    - it can control rate of messages to be consumed to prevent being overwhelmed

## Questions?

- job queue, message queue, message brokers?
- differentiate message queue vs LB (reverse proxy)? both are intermediary component.
  - LB: do not remove deps btw senders & receivers, no queueing capability.
- rabbitMQ vs kafka?
- pull: how it is scheduled, works like cronjob?
- kafka message contains sender and receivers?
- concrete examples for using distributed queues adn pubsub?
- can partitions kafka of one topic stays in different machines.
  - yes. each machine runs a broker instance.
  - partitions of one topic can be spread accross machines
  - better perf and scalability.
- can one machine have many broker instances?
  - one machine one broker
- can one broker instance have many topics?
- how to decide what partition in a topic to put message to?

  - implicit
    - no partition specified: `hash(key)`
    - no key specified: `round-robin`
  - explicit(partition specified) => client must know about topic (coupling)

- when global ordering matters? how to deal with that?
  - one partition per topic
- when global order does not matter?
  - purchases from diff users,
    - key: userId => purchases event from 1 user go to one partition (order maintained)
    - example: `userA:refund` > `userA:purchase`
- how to roughly estimate parallelism of one topics?
  - number of partitions
  - one topic has 5 partitions means 5 partitions can work in parallel (if we have at least 5 cores)
- what decides number of partitions?
  - number of messages
  - is there a formular for doing so?
- example of multiple publishers publish to one topic
- what decides number of consumers in group? is this auto-scaling or configuable?
- role of timestamp in message payload? how it can be used?
- diagram replication factor N = 2, with 4 partition in 4 broker instances
  - how partition is replicated
- how kafka knows a message has been consumed?
  - autoCommit (by kafka) when msg is read: consumers might break before processing msg!!!
  - consumers manually commit

## kafka specifics

- message payload: key(optional), value, timestamp
- topics: category of messages
- partitions:
  - each is a queue
  - one topic can have many partitions (collection of queues)
  - exists for scaling reasons?
    - horizontal scaling
    - perf: parallelism
  - record is appended to end of queue (published order) with seq num (offset)
  - no global ordering btw partitions in a topic
- consumer group
  - can have multiple consumer instances => avoid bottleneck, less msg for one instance
  - messages published to a group, are load-balanced amongts instances
- replication factor
  - N means each partition is replicated by N kafka brokers
  - replicas set: 1 leader many followers (master-slaves arch)
    - leader takes all reads, writes
    - followers stay in sync with leader (take over if leader fails), ONLY used in case of failure
- reliability:
  - persists messages in disk
  - keep messages after being consumed by consumers. why? retry, new consumers join, fast recover for failed brokers
  - server.properties: `log.retention.hours=168`
