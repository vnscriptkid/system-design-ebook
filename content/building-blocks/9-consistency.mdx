All systems need consistency, but the level of consistency could be different

## Consistency models

- Strong
- Eventual

## Consistency in Contexts

- Replication context: consider master-slaves architecture

  - less **consistency** (eventual consistency):
    - (1) write to master,
    - (2) write is successful,
    - (3) propagation to slaves is done async
  - high **consistency**:
    - (1) write to master,
    - (2) propagate update to all slaves synchronously,
    - (3) write is successfull

- Delegation context:

  - eventual consistency:
    - (1) create new blog
    - (2) delegate job incrementing blog_count of user to kafka
    - (3) returns success => async job could take a while to run, causing inconsistency btw blog_count in UI and real number of blogs

- ACID Database Transaction context
  - conrrectness through defined rules:
    - account balance >+ 0, stock quantity >= 0 (`constraint`)
    - no orphan comment (`cascade`)
