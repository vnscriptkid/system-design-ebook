All systems need consistency, but the level of consistency could be different

## Consistency models

- Strong
- Eventual

## Consistency in Contexts

- Replication context: consider master-slaves architecture
  - less **consistency** (eventual consistency):
    - (1) write to master,
    - (2) write is successful,
    - (3) propagation to slaves is done async
  - high **consistency**: (1) write to master, (2) propagate update to all slaves synchronously, (3) write is successfull
