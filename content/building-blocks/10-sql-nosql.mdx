## Comparisons

- SQL
  - Structured, enforce data to follow fixed shema
  - Change schema by migrations
  - ACID
  - Hard to scale horizontally, best to have data all in one machine
- NoSQL
  - Flexible, no structure, no schema
  - Eventual consistency
  - Inherently scalable, scale horizontally by sharding

## Types of NoSQL DBs

- Key-Value Stores: S3 (object store - amazon), Redis, DynamoDB (amazon), memcached
  - 2 types: (1) object stores (2) in-memory dbs
  - think of distributed hash table
  - features: replication, fault tolerance, scalability
  - `insert(key, JSON(...))`
- Wide-columns DBs: HBase, Cassandra (also key-value store), BigTable
- Document Stores: MongoDB
- Graph DBs

## Questions

- object store (s3) vs file system

  - object store: is key-value store, stores large objects, where files (images, videos) are determined by `key`
  - file system: files are determined by paths, directories

- redis vs memcached
