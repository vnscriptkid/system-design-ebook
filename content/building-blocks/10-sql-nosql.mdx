  - Change schema by migrations
  - ACID

  - Flexible, no structure, no schema
  - Eventual consistency
  - Inherently scalable, scale horizontally by sharding

## Types of NoSQL DBs

- Key-Value Stores: S3, Redis, DynamoDB (amazon)
  - think of distributed hash table
  - features: replication, fault tolerance, scalability
  - `insert(key, JSON(...))`
- Wide-columns DBs: HBase, Cassandra (also key-value store), BigTable
