## Context

- Distributed systems

## Def

- **Consistency**: at any times, all clients should see the same data
- **Availability**: system always respond with data in case of nodes failure
- **Partition Tolerance**: system continues to operate in case of nodes communication breaks

## Statements

- 3 props at the same time is impossible
  - CP: consistency + partition tolerance
  - AP: availability + partition tolerance
  - AC: unrelistic, why? network breaks always happen in the real-world
- PROBLEM boils down to **consistency** vs **availability**

## Questions

<img src="/building-blocks/cap.png" style={{ width: 500 }} alt="crate.io" />

- when to choose consistency over availability? in what kind of systems?
- in high-consistent system, how to handle case of data in-consistency due to network break?
- if we choose availability? what is the worst thing could happen?
