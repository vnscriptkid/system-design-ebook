## Backend Components/Techniques

- Caching: static pages, feed
- CDN
- Compressing videos, images
  - reduce size
  - images: store low,medium,high-quality images
- Geolocation
  - reduce latency
- Adding more machines
- Load Balancer
  - avoid SoF: have back-up
  - lower latency: direct reqs to server that is free
  - higher throughput: distribute reqs evenly to avoid bottleneck
- Job Queue
  - what to queue? things do not need immediate response/processing
  - examples: hit like, send email, upload images (cpu intensive), notifications

## Database Optimizations:

- Indexing
  - pros: faster reads
  - cons: create redundancy, slower write (need to write to 2 separate tables)
- Replication
- Batching writes: TODO
- Do Reads/Writes from workers: TODO
- Lock as less as possible

## Frontend

- Minifying CSS, JS
- Code splitting, Lazy loading
- Load low-resolution first
- Compressing images
- Prefetching: reqs that are likely to be called next
- HTTP caching

```js
// purchase flow
/*
    updateProductAvailability(product_id) => lock row level, keep it short

    processPayment() => no need to keep the lock til here
*/
```

## Questions?

- Why not to offload task `adding friend` to job queue?
- How reqs are redirected to nearby server (geolocation)? DNS load balander!?!
