## Naive setup

- context: single server
- API, data modeling

```js
// POST /messages
 {
     senderId: 1,
     receiverId: 2,
     content: 'hello',
     createdAt: '2022-04-21'
 }

 // data modeling (messages)
 messages {
     id: number,
     name: string, // user1_user2
     senderId: number,
     receiverId: number,
     content: string,
     createdAt: datetime
 }

 // sql: get all direct messages between 2 people
 /*
    select * from messages
    where name = user1_user2
    order by createdAt asc
    where createdAt >= :cursor
 */
```

- socket for realtime messaging:
  - context: `user1` and `user2` are friends
  - user 1 goes online
  - user 1 subscribes to socket channel `user1_user2` (user2 is offline at this point)
  - user 2 goes online
  - user 2 subscribes to socket channel `user1_user2`
  - the channel `user1_user2` broadcasts message `online` to `user1`
  - `user1` sees online status of `user2`

## Advanced setup

- message status:

  - sent: persist to database
  - delivered: persist to receiver's phone (may not read yet)
  - read: seen (configurable)

- `userA` sends message to `userB` flow
  - assuming both connect to different servers (gateways)
  - `userA` sends msg to `gateway 1` (sent), it needs to know (1) is `userB` online (2) if he's online, what server he is connected to
  - for these questions, it asks `SessionService`, this service stores mapping user-server (who is connected to which server)
    - msg is persisted to database (queue ?!?)
    - if `userB` is online and is connected to `gateway 2`, `SerssionService` routes the msg to `gateway 2`, then `gateway 2` sends msg back to `userB` through websocket (delivered)
  - `userB` opens app and sees the msg (read)
