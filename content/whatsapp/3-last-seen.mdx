title: Last seen feature
slug: /whatsapp/last-seen
---

## UI

<img src="/whatsapp/last_seen.png" style={{ width: 300 }} alt="crate.io" />

## Considerations

- definition of online
- what info to store and where
- differentiate user activity and app activity

## Design decisions

- each time userA sends req to server, that is his `lastSeen`
- online means `Date.now() - lastSeen > 20s`
- what to store: mapping `{ userId: lastSeenAt }`
- where to store: `PresenceService`
- example flow:
  - userA sends req to server to do something...
  - server sends req to `PresenceService` to update `userA`'s lastSeen
- user activity vs app activity
  - user activity => do update lastSeen
  - app activity => something happens automatically in background, not by user => do not update lastSeen
