## High-level design

- 3 positions where can we put rate-limiter?
- give simple example of a rate limiting case?
- standard http code for too many req?
- describe algorithms, pros and cons
- Design decisions:
  - why to choose redis?
  - what features of redis do we need? names of command?
  - describe flow of excess reqs comming to our system, and get blocked
