## Video uploading

- DAG (directed acyclic graph)
  - why?
  - features?
  - how original video is broken down
  - what does inspection step do?
  - how thumbnails are created, by whom?
  - what does watermark step do?
  - example output of video encoding step?

<img src="/youtube/dag-flow.png" style={{ width: 500 }} alt="crate.io" />

- DAG flow:
  - responsibilities of preprocessor:
    - GOP: stands for? def? why GOP?
    - build graph (nane + input + output): when to run in sequence or parallel
    - cache: why to cache? when to use that cache? when cache is cleared?
  - dag scheduler:
    - why graph is split into stages?
    - how tasks are put into task queues?
  - resource manager:
    - what are components? what does each one do?
    - describe a flow step by step of how tasks are processed here
  - task workers
  - temporary storage

## Optimizations

- video uploading:
  - GOP: in client side
  - upload in parallel
- upload server geographic position matters
- parallelize dependent steps by message queues
- optimize safety:
  - how to ensure only authorized users can upload videos to right location
  - what are the names of cloud services that provide this kind of protection
    - amazon?
    - google?
    - microsoft?
  - describe the new flow
- optimize copyrights
  - DRM: stands for?
  - AES: how does this help? what config do we need to provide?
  - visual watermarking
- cost-saving:
  - 20-80, categorize videos?
  - build CDN, partner with ISPs

## Error handling

- categorize errors:
  - recoverable error:
    - transcode, action?
    - client can't split vid to GOP, action?
    - preprocessor error, action?
    - scheduler error, action?
    - queue down, action?
    - api server down, action?
    - meta cache down, action?
    - meta db master down, action?
    - meta db slaves down, action?
  - non-recoverable error:
    - examples: malformed vid
    - action?
