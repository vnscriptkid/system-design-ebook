## Data Partition

- Why do we need this feature at all?
- Differentiate partition vs physical machine? Is one machine a partition?
- 2 challenges of data partitioning?
- how consistent hashing solves those problems?

## Data Replication

- Why do we need replication? What we are trading?
- How many machines to which data is replicated?
- How to decide what machines to replicate to in hash ring?
  - how to handle virtual nodes?
  - what is the cons of replicating data to machines in the same data center? What could bring better reliability?

## Consistency

- How quorum consensus guarantees strict consistency?
- Explain params: N, W, R
- How to handle case: data are different amongst R reads? (data inconsistency)
- W=1 means data is replicated to only one server? Clarify?
- Why W + R > N provides strong consistency? Take an example of 5 replicas?
- Demonstrate that even with strict consistency, there's still rooms for high availability (a node's failure)
- Demonstrate that if threshold is crossed, reads and writes could be blocked?
- Choose values that optimizes for fast reads, fast writes?
- Why key-value stores are often favor of eventual-consistency?

## Inconsistency resolution

- Give concrete example when data inconsistency happens?
- Explain `D([S1, v1], [S2, v2], ..., [Sn, vn])` in vector-clock?
- What happens if data `D` is written to server `S(i)`

## Handling failures

- Explain the process of detecting failures using gossip protocol with heartbeats
- Explain how "sloppy quorum" can improve availability?
- Differentiate btw temporary and permanent failures?
- How to handle permanent failures? How merkle tree helps?
- How to handle data center outage?

## Architectural diagram

- What is the role of coordinator? Does it store data?
- How to determine node to store data? How data is replicated?
- What are the responsibilities of each node? Is every node the same?
- How auto-scaling happens? What mechanism makes it possible?

## Write path

<img src="/key-value-store/write-path.png" style={{ width: 500 }} alt="crate.io" />

- Why it needs to first write to commit log?
- What is SSTables? Why do we need it?

## Read path

<img src="/key-value-store/read-path.png" style={{ width: 500 }} alt="crate.io" />

- What is bloom filter? How does it help?
