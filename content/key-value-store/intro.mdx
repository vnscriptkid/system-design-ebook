## Requirements

- Operations:
  - `put(key, value)`
  - `get(key)`

## Naive

- hashtable, single machine
- cons:
  - limited scalability
  - single point of failure (low availability & no fault tolerance)

## Components of distributed key-value store

- data partition
- data replication
- consistency
- inconsistency resolution
- handling failures
- write path
- read path
