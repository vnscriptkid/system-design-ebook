## Data modeling

```js

users {
    id: ID,
    username: string,
    password: string,
    avatar: string,
    friends: [ID],
    posts: [ID]
}

posts {
    id: ID,
    author_id: ID,
    caption: string,
    low_quality_image: string,
    high_quality_image: string,
    total_likes: number,
    liked_users: [ID]
}

// likes {
//     src_user: ID,
//     dest_user: ID
// }

feeds {
    user_id: ID,
    latest_posts: [ID], (~100 posts)
    old_posts: [ID]
}
```

## Design decisions:

- why to choose `cassandra`?
  - does this app need high-consistency?
  - where do we need consistency in the app? How to add consistency for operation in cassandra?
  - scalability? for each data models, how do they grow over time?
- fanout pattern `feeds`
  - pros and cons?
  - why do we need `latest_posts` and `old_posts`?
  - estimate size of a feed row when there's 100.000 posts
  - what is the record size's limit of cassandra? what if there's more posts than the limit?
  - how transfering posts from `latest_posts` to `old_posts` happen? (when 101st post is added)
- `users`:
  - keep `friends` list inside, why?
  - keep `posts` list inside, why?
- `posts`:
  - keep 2 versions of image, why?
  - keep `liked_users`, why?

## Walkthrough

- Describe photo upload flow?
  - where photos are stored?
- Describe flow of adding a post?

  - what are the tables get effected?
  - what is the naive solution to implement this? why is it bad? when it goes worse?
  - what work could be defered? How to implement this?
  - what could be cached here? what is the benefit? what cache invalidation strategies to use?
  - what if user needs more than 100 + 100.000 posts? what are 2 directions can we go?

- Describe flow user hitting like?

  - why this can be defered?
  - how post's owner gets notified?

- Describe flow adding friends?

  - should this be async or sync? why?

- Describe flow of viewing my own photos?
  - what is a must feature here when fetching an unbounded list? how to implement?

## Perf:

    - Geolocation: Why, how, explain?
    - Caching: what could be cached (frequenly read, read by many peoples), how to cache them, invalidation strategies?
    - Job queues
        - what is the idea?
        - what could be put in job queue? examples?
        - how to make sure job queue is efficient?

## Deeper

- subsystems:
  - database
  - load balancer
  - scale file storage
- features:
- more features:
  - user can share their location
