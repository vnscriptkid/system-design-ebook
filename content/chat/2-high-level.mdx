## High-level design

<img src="/chat/naive.png" style={{ width: 400 }} alt="crate.io" />

- Describe message flow?
- Differentiate stateful services and stateless services? When to use what?
- Decision on communication stragegies? What are the options? pros and cons before coming to decision?
- Starting with naive solution with single chat server? assume each connection needs 10K.
  Then how much RAM needed to maintain 1M concurrent conn?
- What are the problems with single server?

- non-sql or sql or both?
  - what data to store? can we categorize it? how does number of each type grow over time?
  - other factors:
    - proven apps of this kind,
    - read-write patterns:
      - how often users read new and old data, random access (search)
      - read-write ratio
    - long tail of data handling

## Data modeling

<img src="/chat/message-model-2.png" style={{ width: 200 }} alt="crate.io" />

- Why not to use `createdAt` to determine messages order?
- How to generate auto-incremented ids for non-sql? global or local? why?
- What is the partition key? Why? (sharding)
